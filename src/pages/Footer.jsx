          SOHHO is a techno club in New York, SoHHo. The trademark is the famous
          smiley, which moves through the entire project. To make the whole
          project even more uniform, only the colors yellow and black were used.
          We designed an interactive website as well as a poster and cover
          series. In addition, we are working on a part for the branding of the
          club.{" "}
